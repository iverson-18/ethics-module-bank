This repository contains a database and backend system for managing Ethics exam questions. It was created to help professors easily add, organize, and generate test questions per module. 
The system supports multiple question types (multiple choice, true/false, identification) and allows both manual and random selection of questions for creating exams.

The goal is to provide a simple, user-friendly tool that enables efficient test preparation without requiring technical knowledge of databases or programming.
